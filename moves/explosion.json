Choose a target within range and roll a d20. On a 20, the explosion goes off and all creatures within 5 feet of that point faint. On any other roll, the explosion fails to go off and this move has no effect. If the target's level is 10 more than your own, or their SR is 15, this move automatically fails."],"contest":{"id":"explosion","contest":"beauty","appeal":8,"jam":0,"effect":"A move of huge appeal, but using it prevents the user from taking further contest moves."}}

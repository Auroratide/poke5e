When a creature in range activates a Move that directly targets another creature, you may use your reaction to force the creature to make a CHA save against your Move DC. On a fail, the Move must target you instead. If you are out of range of the Move, the creature must use their remaining movement to move in a straight line towards you before making the attack (does not provoke attacks of opportunity). If you are still out of range, the move automatically fails."],"save":{"attribute":["cha"],"dc":"MOVE"},"contest":{"id":"follow-me","contest":"cute","appeal":3,"jam":0,"effect":"Temporarily stops the crowd from growing excited."},"pokemon":[{"id":"clefairy","name":"Clefairy"},{"id":"sentret","name":"Sentret"},{"id":"furret","name":"Furret"},{"id":"togepi","name":"Togepi"},{"id":"togetic","name":"Togetic"},{"id":"pachirisu","name":"Pachirisu"},{"id":"maushold","name":"Maushold"},{"id":"ogerpon","name":"Ogerpon (Teal Mask)"},{"id":"ogerpon-wellspring-mask","name":"Ogerpon (Wellspring Mask)"},{"id":"ogerpon-heartflame-mask","name":"Ogerpon (Heartflame Mask)"},{"id":"ogerpon-cornerstone-mask","name":"Ogerpon (Cornerstone Mask)"}]}

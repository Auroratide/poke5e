When a creature in range activates a Move that directly targets another creature, you may use your reaction to force the creature to make a CHA save against your Move DC. On a fail, the Move must target you instead. If you are out of range of the Move, the creature must use their remaining movement to move in a straight line towards you before making the attack (does not provoke attacks of opportunity). If you are still out of range, the move automatically fails."],"contest":{"id":"follow-me","contest":"cute","appeal":3,"jam":0,"effect":"Temporarily stops the crowd from growing excited."}}

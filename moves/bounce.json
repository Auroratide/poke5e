During this time, you are immune to the damage and effects of any move. If you have no remaining movement or are grappled/restrained before activating this move, the move fails. On your next turn, as an action, you reappear and attempt to slam down on top of a creature. Make a melee attack roll on a creature in range, with advantage, doing 2d8 + MOVE flying damage on a hit. On a natural attack roll of 15 or more, the target is paralyzed."],"higherLevels":"The damage dice roll for this move changes to 2d10 at level 5, 3d10 at level 10, and 4d12 at level 17.","contest":{"id":"bounce","contest":"cute","appeal":1,"jam":0,"effect":"Prevents the user from being startled until the turn ends."}}

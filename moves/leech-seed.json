Make a ranged attack roll. On a hit, a seed implants into their skin. The target takes 1d4 grass damage at the end of each of its subsequent turns until it faints or is switched out. Half of the damage is restored by the attacker, or any other active creature the trainer has in battle, even if the original attacker faints or is returned to its Pok√©ball. Only one creature can be seeded by the attacker at a time. Grass-type creatures are immune to the damage from this move."],"higherLevels":"The damage dice roll for this move changes to 2d4 at level 5, 2d6 at level 10, and 2d8 at level 17."}

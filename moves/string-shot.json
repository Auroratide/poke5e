Make a ranged attack roll against a target. On a hit, the targetâ€™s speed is reduced by 10 for the duration. The move is stackable to any amount. The target may take an action to attempt to get rid of any string with a STR save against your Move DC. If this reduction in speed causes their speed to be 0, they are restrained."],"contest":{"id":"string-shot","contest":"clever","appeal":2,"jam":3,"effect":"Startles the last Pokemon to act before the user."},"pokemon":[{"id":"caterpie","name":"Caterpie"},{"id":"weedle","name":"Weedle"},{"id":"spinarak","name":"Spinarak"},{"id":"ariados","name":"Ariados"},{"id":"wurmple","name":"Wurmple"},{"id":"sewaddle","name":"Sewaddle"},{"id":"swadloon","name":"Swadloon"},{"id":"leavanny","name":"Leavanny"},{"id":"joltik","name":"Joltik"},{"id":"galvantula","name":"Galvantula"},{"id":"larvesta","name":"Larvesta"},{"id":"volcarona","name":"Volcarona"},{"id":"scatterbug","name":"Scatterbug"},{"id":"grubbin","name":"Grubbin"},{"id":"charjabug","name":"Charjabug"},{"id":"vikavolt","name":"Vikavolt"},{"id":"tarountula","name":"Tarountula"},{"id":"spidops","name":"Spidops"}]}

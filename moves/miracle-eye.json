When activating this move, choose a target in range and force them to make a WIS save against your Move DC. On a failure, any modifiers to their AC are reset, and if they are Dark or Ghost-type, their immunities are relinquished for the duration. If, when losing immunity, the targetâ€™s secondary type gives it vulnerability or resistance to an attack of that type, it follows the secondary type for that effect."]}

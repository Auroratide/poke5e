When activating this move, choose a target in range and force them to make a WIS save against your Move DC. On a failure, any modifiers to their AC are reset, and if they are Dark or Ghost-type, their immunities are relinquished for the duration. If, when losing immunity, the target’s secondary type gives it vulnerability or resistance to an attack of that type, it follows the secondary type for that effect."],"save":{"attribute":["wis"],"dc":"MOVE"},"contest":{"id":"miracle-eye","contest":"clever","appeal":2,"jam":0,"effect":"Works great if the user goes first this turn."},"pokemon":[{"id":"kadabra","name":"Kadabra"},{"id":"alakazam","name":"Alakazam"},{"id":"mewtwo","name":"Mewtwo"},{"id":"natu","name":"Natu"},{"id":"xatu","name":"Xatu"},{"id":"smoochum","name":"Smoochum"},{"id":"metang","name":"Metang"},{"id":"metagross","name":"Metagross"},{"id":"sigilyph","name":"Sigilyph"},{"id":"gothita","name":"Gothita"},{"id":"elgyem","name":"Elgyem"},{"id":"beheeyem","name":"Beheeyem"},{"id":"meowstic-m","name":"Meowstic ♂"}]}

{"id":"disable","name":"Disable","type":"normal","power":["cha","wis"],"time":"1 action","pp":5,"duration":"1 minute, concentration","range":"60ft","description":["You attempt to disable a target, hindering its moves. Choose a target in range. The target must succeed on a WIS saving throw against your Move DC. On a failed save, the last Move it activated is unable to be used while you hold your concentration. (If this would end Solar Beam, Skull Bash, etc. during the charge phase of the Move, the Move automatically fails on the target's next turn)."]}

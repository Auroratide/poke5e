{"id":"mud-sport","name":"Mud Sport","type":"ground","power":"none","time":"1 action","pp":10,"duration":"1 minute","range":"self (5ft radius)","description":["You cover yourself and all allies around you with thick mud, reducing the amount of electric damage taken for anyone affected. For the duration, you and any ally in range (when you initially activated this move) have resistance to electric-type attacks. If you were already resistant, you are now immune. If you were vulnerable, you now take regular damage. If you are immune to electric- type moves already, nothing happens."]}

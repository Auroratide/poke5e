If the move requires an attack roll, you have disadvantage on the attack. If the move requires a saving throw, the target has advantage on the roll. If the move causes damage, double the damage dice. The damage/effect tier for the move is based off of your level, not the target's."],"contest":{"id":"me-first","contest":"clever","appeal":3,"jam":0,"effect":"Causes the user to move earlier on the next turn."}}

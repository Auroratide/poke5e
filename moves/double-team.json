{"id":"double-team","name":"Double Team","type":"normal","power":"none","time":"1 bonus action","pp":3,"duration":"1 minute, concentration","range":"self","description":["You create a duplicate image of yourself, 5 feet beside you. The image mimics you and attempt to fool your opponents into attacking it, instead.","When subject to any move (attack or saving throw / damaging or non-damaging) with an area of effect of 5 feet wide or less, roll a d4. On a result of 3 or 4, the image absorbs the damage and/or effects of the attack and disappears. Creatures with Truesight bypass the effect of this move. If grappled or restrained by a creature while Double Team is active, Double Team has no effect. (Examples that would trigger the roll include Tackle, Thunder Wave, Rock Slide, etc.)"],"optional":["When this move is used again before the duplicate is consumed, an additional duplicate is created, up to a maximum of three duplicates.","With two duplicates, the attacker must roll a 5 or 6 on a d6 to hit the target. With three duplicates, the attacker must roll a 7 or 8 on a d8."]}

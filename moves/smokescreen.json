The area on either side is obscured and imposes disadvantage on any ranged attacks made by a creature targeting another on the opposite side. Any creature inside the wall of smoke, when it is conjured, must make a CON save against your Move DC or become blinded for the duration. A blinded creature can repeat the save at the beginning of its turns to remove the effect on a success."],"contest":{"id":"smokescreen","contest":"clever","appeal":2,"jam":3,"effect":"Startles the last Pokemon to act before the user."}}

The Gym Leader controls two pokémon simultaneously, and two players each control one pokémon. The players not currently battling wait for one of their pokémon to be subbed in, either because one of the active pokémon fainted or because the Switch action was taken.</p> <p>The battle continues until either one pokémon from each player has fainted, or all of the Gym Leader&#39;s pokémon have fainted.

Player 3 and 4 sit on the sideline."/> <figcaption><p>Players 3 and 4 can be switched into the battle.</p></figcaption></figure> <h3>Full Team vs Full Team</h3> <p>Each player controls a single pokémon on the battle field. The Gym Leader recruits employees at their gym to help out, and together they control a total number of pokémon equal to the number of players. The battle is two full teams fighting against each other at once!</p> <p>The match is over once all pokémon on a team have fainted.</p> <figure><img src="${ge}" alt="Players 1, 2, 3, and 4 face off against the gym leader and two extras."/> <figcaption><p>The extra opponents help the Gym Leader manage four or more pokémon.</p></figcaption></figure> <h3>Parallel 1v1s</h3> <p>If it&#39;s preferred to earn gym badges individually, you can still run the battles in such a way that everyone participates at the same time rather than each player awaiting their turn.</p> <p>You run an independent battle for each player, but in parallel. For example, Player 1 makes their action first, followed by the Gym Leader&#39;s response. Next, Player 2 makes their action in their battle, followed by the Gym Leader&#39;s response. And this continues until the last player&#39;s field has made their actions, and it loops back to Player 1.</p> <p>The advantage to running individual battles in parallel is all players participate together. The tradeoff is that as the DM, you essentially need to manage a board state for each player. It is up to you whether this is easier or harder than running single battles consecutively.</p> <figure><img src="${de}" alt="Players 1, 2, 3, and 4 engage in individual battles against the Gym Leader."/> <figcaption><p>Each battle is technically isolated from the others.</p></figcaption></figure>`,I;return w=new ce({props:{equals:"Money",expression:"(highest level pokémon)d4 × 100"}}),{c(){e=u("section"),e.innerHTML=i,n=f(),o=u("section"),o.innerHTML=v,p=f(),t=u("section"),r=u("h2"),r.textContent=l,y=f(),x=u("p"),x.textContent=F,N=f(),P=u("p"),P.textContent=z,O=f(),_=u("ul"),_.innerHTML=j,R=f(),C=u("p"),C.textContent=J,q=f(),L=u("h3"),L.textContent=U,B=f(),$=u("p"),$.textContent=V,W=f(),ae(w.$$.fragment),A=f(),M=u("p"),M.innerHTML=Y,D=f(),H=u("p"),H.textContent=K,G=f(),T=u("section"),T.innerHTML=Q},l(s){e=c(s,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(e)!=="svelte-1db0lx2"&&(e.innerHTML=i),n=d(s),o=c(s,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(o)!=="svelte-10mrbu2"&&(o.innerHTML=v),p=d(s),t=c(s,"SECTION",{});var a=pe(t);r=c(a,"H2",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(r)!=="svelte-tgeepi"&&(r.textContent=l),y=d(a),x=c(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(x)!=="svelte-1lmtzbi"&&(x.textContent=F),N=d(a),P=c(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(P)!=="svelte-1od7spw"&&(P.textContent=z),O=d(a),_=c(a,"UL",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(_)!=="svelte-vk51ps"&&(_.innerHTML=j),R=d(a),C=c(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(C)!=="svelte-8lbz1b"&&(C.textContent=J),q=d(a),L=c(a,"H3",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(L)!=="svelte-928sgv"&&(L.textContent=U),B=d(a),$=c(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m($)!=="svelte-esrzh0"&&($.textContent=V),W=d(a),ne(w.$$.fragment,a),A=d(a),M=c(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(M)!=="svelte-1pc4hf0"&&(M.innerHTML=Y),D=d(a),H=c(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(H)!=="svelte-1kh9iaf"&&(H.textContent=K),a.forEach(g),G=d(s),T=c(s,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(T)!=="svelte-19eutkh"&&(T.innerHTML=Q)},m(s,a){b(s,e,a),b(s,n,a),b(s,o,a),b(s,p,a),b(s,t,a),h(t,r),h(t,y),h(t,x),h(t,N),h(t,P),h(t,O),h(t,_),h(t,R),h(t,C),h(t,q),h(t,L),h(t,B),h(t,$),h(t,W),te(w,t,null),h(t,A),h(t,M),h(t,D),h(t,H),b(s,G,a),b(s,T,a),I=!0},i(s){I||(S(w.$$.fragment,s),I=!0)},o(s){E(w.$$.fragment,s),I=!1},d(s){s&&(g(e),g(n),g(o),g(p),g(t),g(G),g(T)),ee(w)}}}function be(k){let e,i="<p>There will be essentially two types of encounters in Pokémon 5e: Wild Pokémon encounters and Trainer Battles.</p>",n,o,v="<h2>Wild Pokémon</h2> <p>Wild Pokémon encounters should be treated with caution.

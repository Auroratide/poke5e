Pokémon downed in sanctioned combat do not need to make death saving throws.</li> <li>In other combat scenarios (e.g. a wild battle), downed Pokémon must make death saving throws until stabilized.</li> <li>While inside a Pokéball, a Pokémon does not need to make death saving throws. After spending 10 uninterrupted minutes inside a Pokéball, the Pokémon stabilizes at 0 HP.</li> <li>When a trainer&#39;s Pokémon reaches 0 HP, the trainer may use their reaction to immediately recall the Pokémon to its pokéball and send out another Pokémon.</li></ul> <h3>Pokémon Death</h3> <p>Like in D&amp;D 5e, a Pokémon dies if it reaches its third failed death saving throw. There is no known way for a deceased Pokémon to be revived.

In a traditional Pokémon setting, Pokécenters offer their services for free to those with Trainer Licenses.</p> <p>Neither PP nor hit dice are replenished at a Pokécenter.</p> <p>Pokécenters are also able to treat more serious injuries Pokémon endure, the same way a hospital would for people. Such operations usually take longer than 30 minutes.</p> <h3>Resting</h3> <p>Long rests take at least eight hours and refresh all Pokémon health, statuses, and PP.</p> <p>Short rests can be as little as a half an hour and recover hit points based on normal 5e rules. PP is not recovered on short rests, and short rests do not revive fainted Pokémon.</p> <h3>Potions and Food</h3> <p>Certain items and food can be given to Pokémon as an action, or in some cases consumed as a reaction, to restore HP, PP, or status. These items cannot be given to Pokémon within Pokéballs.</p>";return{c(){t=u("section"),t.innerHTML=r,n=P(),o=u("section"),o.innerHTML=e,s=P(),i=u("section"),i.innerHTML=k},l(a){t=c(a,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(t)!=="svelte-uv9sqy"&&(t.innerHTML=r),n=f(a),o=c(a,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(o)!=="svelte-1isvfnj"&&(o.innerHTML=e),s=f(a),i=c(a,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(i)!=="svelte-11d76st"&&(i.innerHTML=k)},m(a,h){m(a,t,h),m(a,n,h),m(a,o,h),m(a,s,h),m(a,i,h)},p:T,d(a){a&&(l(t),l(n),l(o),l(s),l(i))}}}function S(d){let t,r,n,o;return t=new x({props:{value:"Fainting, Resting, and Healing"}}),n=new L({props:{title:"Fainting, Resting, and Healing",$$slots:{default:[I]},$$scope:{ctx:d}}}),{c(){_(t.$$.fragment),r=P(),_(n.$$.fragment)},l(e){b(t.$$.fragment,e),r=f(e),b(n.$$.fragment,e)},m(e,s){w(t,e,s),m(e,r,s),w(n,e,s),o=!0},p(e,[s]){const i={};s&1&&(i.$$scope={dirty:s,ctx:e}),n.$set(i)},i(e){o||($(t.$$.fragment,e),$(n.$$.fragment,e),o=!0)},o(e){v(t.$$.fragment,e),v(n.$$.fragment,e),o=!1},d(e){e&&l(r),g(t,e),g(n,e)}}}class z extends H{constructor(t){super(),C(this,t,null,S,y,{})}}export{z as component};

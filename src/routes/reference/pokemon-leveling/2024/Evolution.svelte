	<li>It keeps its current ability scores, but gains points to distribute towards any of those scores. No more than 4 of these points may be put into a single stat and no stat may be increased above 20. The number of points to distribute is provided on its stat block. These points cannot be used to acquire feats, unless specified otherwise.</li>
	<li>It gains an HP bonus of double its level.</li>
	<li>It acquires the hit dice of its evolved form to increase HP this level and for future rolls.</li>
	<li>It acquires the base AC of its evolved form, all new proficiencies, and vulnerabilities/resistances/immunities.</li>
	<li>If it loses its current ability by evolving, it should exchange its current known ability for any one of its evolved form's abilities.</li>
	<li> It keeps the known moves it had before evolution, but must learn all future moves from its new move list. For example, Pikachu evolving into Raichu at level 10 cannot learn any of Pikachu's level 10 moves.</li>

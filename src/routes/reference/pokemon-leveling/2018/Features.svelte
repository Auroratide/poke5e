<h3>New Moves</h3>
<p>Pokémon cannot know more than 4 moves at one time. Every time your Pokémon levels up, you may replace any one move it knows with any of the moves listed on its stat block at its level or lower. At levels 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18, your Pokémon gains access to new moves.</p>
<p>After evolving, a Pokémon retains all the moves it currently knows, even if its known moves are no longer listed on the evolved form's stat block. However, when switching a move upon level up, it may not learn a move from its previous evolutionary forms; only moves from its current form may be learned.</p>

<h3>STAB Increase</h3>
<p><abbr>STAB</abbr> is an abbreviation for Same-Type Attack Bonus. Your Pokémon gains a bonus to damage rolls when it uses an attack move type that is the same as their Pokémon type. STAB may only be added once per move, even for moves that deal damage over time like Leech Seed, Smog, etc. This bonus increases as the Pokémon levels up.</p>

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>Your Pokémon gains a number of points to allocate to any of its ability scores, to a maximum of 20. The number of points to allocate depends on the number of evolutionary stages in that Pokémon's line:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>1 stage:</strong> 4 points</li>
	<li><strong>2 stages:</strong> 3 points</li>
	<li><strong>3 stages:</strong> 2 points</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to 2 of these points may be used to acquire a <a href="{Url.reference.feats()}">Feat</a> instead.</p>
<p>This happens at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.</p>

<h3>Damage Increase</h3>
<p>The damage of each damaging move increases at levels 5, 10, and 17, as shown in the move description.</p>

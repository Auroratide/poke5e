		<h2>2018 vs 2024 Rulesets</h2>
		<p>The version of the rules found on this website are slightly updated from the version of the rules originally published in 2018. This is so the community can adopt new Pok√©mon mechanics, reduce complexity, improve balance, adapt to D&D's 2024 rules, etc.</p>
		<p>That said, if you prefer the original rules, you can use the switch found in the title of each rules page. The original ruleset is called "2018" rules, and the updated rules are called "2024" rules.</p>
		<h3>Summary of updates</h3>
		<p>The 2018 and 2024 rules are almost identical, with these notes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Loyalty Levels renamed to Bond Levels, with simpler mechanics.</li>
			<li>Slightly modified DC calculation for making captures.</li>
		</ul>

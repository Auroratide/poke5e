		<h2>2018 vs 2024 Rulesets</h2>
		<p>The version of the rules found on this website are slightly updated from the version of the rules originally published in 2018. This is so the community can adopt new Pokémon mechanics, reduce complexity, improve balance, adapt to D&D's 2024 rules, etc.</p>
		<p>That said, if you prefer the original rules, you can use the switch found in the title of each rules page. The original ruleset is called "2018" rules, and the updated rules are called "2024" rules.</p>
		<h3>Summary of updates</h3>
		<p>The 2018 and 2024 rules are almost identical, with these notes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Loyalty Levels renamed to Bond Levels, with simpler mechanics.</li>
			<li>Slightly modified DC calculation for making captures.</li>
			<li>Combat rules updated to allow for double battles.</li>
			<li>STAB simplified, though buffed at lower levels.</li>
			<li>Pokémon death rules added.</li>
			<li>Adapted feats to D&D 2024 rules, and added a couple new feats.</li>
			<li>Updated natures table to include all actual Pokémon natures.</li>
			<li>Simplified Pokémon experience awards.</li>
			<li>Gave Pokémon a cool level 20 capstone feature.</li>
			<li>Added Z-Moves, Dynamax, and Terastallization.</li>
			<li>Rework trainer specializations to match Pokémon's trainer class names, and make their benefits more symmetrical.</li>
			<li>Made Asleep a volatile condition, added Badly Poisoned, and reworked Confused to work more like the Confusion spell.</li>
			<li>Change trainer hit dice to d6 since they are basically full-casters.</li>
			<li>Added multiclassing potential.</li>
			<li>Simplified weather, so its effect is more subtle, and because the 2018 tables assumed only a specific kind of biome.</li>
		</ul>

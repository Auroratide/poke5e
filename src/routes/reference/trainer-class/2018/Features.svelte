<h3>Trainer License</h3>
<p>Only licensed trainers are permitted to capture Pokémon, and this license identifies you as having such authorization. It also allows trainers to gain access to special services at Pokémon centers and to purchase goods at the Poké Mart.</p>
<p>Trainers can lose their license for attacking other trainers or their Pokémon, or failing to take care of their own Pokémon.</p>

<h3>Starter Pokemon</h3>
<p>A trainer must begin with any single unevolved Pokemon of Species Rating (SR) 1/2 or lower with the base stats in its stat block. This Pokemon starts with a nature and non-hidden ability of the player's choice.</p>

<h3>Pokédex</h3>
<p>A hand-held computer with an advanced camera and image recognition software. A trainer can use a <strong>bonus action</strong> to identify a Pokemon within 60 feet using the Pokedex's scanner. Doing so registers the Pokemon on the Pokedex, and reveals the base SR and some brief facts about the species.</p>

<h3>Pokeslots</h3>
<p>A Trainer’s Pokéslots are the number of Pokémon a Trainer can carry in their pack. At level 1, a Trainer carries their Starter and has two empty slots. Trainers can carry an additional Pokémon at levels 5, 10, and 15.</p>

<h3>Control Upgrade</h3>
<p>Each species of Pokemon is given its own <dfn>Species Rating</dfn> (<abbr>SR</abbr>). The stronger the Pokemon, the more difficult they are to control. The type of Pokemon you can control in the game depends on the level of your character (as seen in the Trainer Level Table).</p>
<p>Without the proper level, a Pokemon with a higher SR than allowed will refuse to leave their Pokeball or obey the trainer's orders. The maximum SR you can control increases at levels 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, and 17.</p>

<h3>Trainer's Resolve</h3>
<p>By the time you reach 10th level, you have had your fair share of experience in difficult battles and have emerged victorious and strong. You are now immune to being frightened, and may choose a second saving throw to become proficient in.</p>

<h3>Pokemon Tracker</h3>
<p>At level 13, you have already spent countless hours in the wild, searching for Pokémon high and low. Once per long rest, you may make a DC 15 WIS check to search for Pokémon in the nearby area. On a success, your DM must tell you what wild Pokémon can be found nearby. On a critical success, a Pokémon of your choice from the DM's list appears in the next encounter.</p>

<h3>Master Trainer</h3>
<p>You have finally achieved the title of Master Trainer. Your Pokémon are at peak fighting performance. When you or your Pokémon fail a saving throw, you may choose to succeed instead. This feature can be used twice per long rest.</p>

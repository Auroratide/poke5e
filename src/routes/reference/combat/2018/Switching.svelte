<p>A trainer may switch out a Pokémon as an action on their turn. If a trainer’s Pokémon faints, it can be switched out immediately as a free action when its trainer is in range.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In order to recall a Pokémon back to its Pokéball, your trainer must be within 60 feet of the creature. If a Pokémon faints outside of this range, it may not be switched until the trainer is within range. A Pokémon released must appear anywhere within 15 feet of the trainer.</li>
	<li>When a Pokémon returns to its Pokéball, concentration ends and all move and item-based buffs and debuffs are nullified. Examples include any effects from Focus Energy, Harden, Sand Attack, Disable, X-Attack, Stockpile, etc. Status effects remain in effect and pause their round duration (for Asleep and Confusion), but damage is not taken from Poison and Burn while inside the Pokéball.</li>
	<li>If a Pokémon switches in to replace another on the same turn, the Pokémon’s speed is reduced by any amount of movement made by the original creature.</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr>STAB</abbr> stands for "Same-Type Attack Bonus". When a Pokémon uses a move with the same type as one of its own types, it gets a STAB bonus added to damage rolls. Otherwise, STAB is 0.</p>
<p>When STAB applies, it is equal to a flat bonus found on the <a href="{Url.reference.pokemonLeveling()}">Pokémon Leveling Table</a>.</p>

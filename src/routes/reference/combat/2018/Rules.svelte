<ul>
	<li>At the start of a battle, you make one initiative roll for both you and your Pokémon using your trainer's initiative bonus.</li>
	<li>Only one Pokémon of yours may be on the battlefield at once.</li>
	<li>Changing out a Pokémon before it has fainted takes up an action, but changing out a Pokémon when it faints can be done immediately as a free action. A Pokémon may not be switched out until after the end of its first full turn in combat (unless by item or move like Volt Switch, U-Turn, etc.)</li>
	<li>On your turn, both your trainer and your active Pokémon have a movement up to their speed, but only one of you may take an action/bonus action. (Trainer may bonus while Rattata may act) A Pokémon Trainer’s job on their turn is to assist their Pokémon in battle by interacting with the environment, providing potions or boosts, commanding their Pokémon to attack, or attempting to run away.</li>
	<li>You <strong>must</strong> have a Pokémon in the battle at all times. If you have no remaining Pokémon, you lose the battle. A battle loss results in you losing half your total money (rounded up), all carried Pokémon lose 1 level of loyalty, and you must immediately use a revive or find a Pokécenter.</li>
	<li>If a Pokémon runs out of PP for all moves, the only move it can use is Struggle. Struggle can be used at any time, regardless of PP remaining in other moves.</li>

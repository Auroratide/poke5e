	<li>At the start of a battle, you make one initiative roll for each of your Pokémon in battle, using your Pokémon's initiative bonus. Your trainer's turn happens concurrently with their first Pokémon in the initiative order.</li>
	<li>A trainer's turn is spent either issuing commands to their Pokémon, using items, or interacting with the environment. As an action, a trainer may issue up to two commands, and only a single command per Pokémon.</li>

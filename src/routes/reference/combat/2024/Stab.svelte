<p><abbr>STAB</abbr> stands for "Same-Type Attack Bonus". When a Pokémon uses a move with the same type as one of its own types, it gets a STAB bonus added to damage rolls. Otherwise, STAB is 0.</p>
<p>When STAB applies, it is equal to the Move Power Mod of the move. This effectively doubles the Move Power Mod of moves that are the same type as the Pokémon using it.</p>

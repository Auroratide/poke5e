<p>A Trainer may take the "switch" action to recall one or two of their Pokémon within line of sight from up to 60 feet away and release new Pokémon within line of sight up to 15 feet away. Changing out a Pokémon before it has fainted takes up an entire action, but changing out a Pokémon when it faints can be done immediately and out of turn as a reaction. A few notes on switching as a reaction:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When a trainer uses their reaction to switch out a fainted pokémon, they may switch out any number of fainted pokémon during that round.</li>
	<li>In a sanctioned trainer battle, if a trainer has no pokémon out at the start of the round, they must immediately use their reaction to switch in new pokémon.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a Pokémon is switched in, it has to take a moment to stablize itself after its recent reformation from pure energy. A Pokémon that has been switched cannot move nor take any actions, reactions, or bonus actions during the current round, unless it is currently the start of a new round.</p>
<p>Switching out a Pokémon does not provoke an attack of oppurtunity on either the trainer or the Pokémon.</p>
<p>When a Pokémon returns to its Pokéball, concentration ends and all move and item-based buffs and debuffs are nullified. Status effects remain in effect and pause their round duration (for Asleep and Confusion), but damage is not taken from Poison and Burn while inside the Pokéball.</p>

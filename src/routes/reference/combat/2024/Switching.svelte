<p>A Trainer may take the "switch" action to recall one of their Pokémon within line of sight from up to 60 feet away and release a new Pokémon within line of sight up to 15 feet away. Changing out a Pokémon before it has fainted takes up an entire action, but changing out a Pokémon when it faints can be done immediately and out of turn as a reaction.</p>
<p>When a Pokémon is switched in, it has to take a moment to stablize itself after its recent reformation from pure energy. A Pokémon that has been switched cannot move nor take any actions, reactions, or bonus actions during the current turn.</p>
<p>Switching out a Pokémon does not provoke an attack of oppurtunity on either the trainer or the Pokémon.</p>
<p>When a Pokémon returns to its Pokéball, concentration ends and all move and item-based buffs and debuffs are nullified. Status effects remain in effect and pause their round duration (for Asleep and Confusion), but damage is not taken from Poison and Burn while inside the Pokéball.</p>

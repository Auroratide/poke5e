		<h2>Encountering Shinies</h2>
		<p>As a DM, when your party encounters a wild Pokémon, consider making a roll to determine whether the Pokémon is shiny! How to roll depends on how rare shinies should be in your game. Some different methods are provided here.</p>

		<h3>1 in 100 Odds</h3>
		<p>In most games, 1 in 100 odds is recommended since the rate of encountering wild Pokémon in a tabletop game is far lower than in the canon Pokémon games.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Roll a d100. On a 100, the Pokémon is shiny.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>1 in 1000 Odds</h3>
		<p>Good for games where there are more encounters with wild Pokémon.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Roll three d10 dice. If every outcome is a 10, the Pokémon is shiny.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>1 in 4096 Odds</h3>
		<p>This represents the actual odds in canon Pokémon games.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Roll four d8 dice. If every outcome is an 8, the Pokémon is shiny.</li>
		</ul>

<p>Pokécenters are small hospital-like facilities that can heal your Pokémon to full health and cure all their statuses in less than 30 minutes. In a traditional Pokémon setting, Pokécenters offer their services for free to those with Trainer Licenses.</p>
<p>Neither PP nor hit dice are replenished at a Pokécenter.</p>
<p>Pokécenters are also able to treat more serious injuries Pokémon endure, the same way a hospital would for people. Such operations usually take longer than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>When a Pokémon reaches 0 HP, what happens to it depends on the circumstances. Additionally, a downed/fainted Pokémon may stabilize in different ways.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In sanctioned combat (e.g. a gym battle), all damage is presumed non-lethal. Pokémon downed in sanctioned combat do not need to make death saving throws.</li>
	<li>In other combat scenarios (e.g. a wild battle), downed Pokémon must make death saving throws until stabilized.</li>
	<li>While inside a Pokéball, a Pokémon does not need to make death saving throws. After spending 10 uninterrupted minutes inside a Pokéball, the Pokémon stabilizes at 0 HP.</li>
	<li>When a trainer's Pokémon reaches 0 HP, the trainer may use their reaction to immediately recall the Pokémon to its pokéball and send out another Pokémon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pokémon Death</h3>
<p>Like in D&D 5e, a Pokémon dies if it reaches its third failed death saving throw. There is no known way for a deceased Pokémon to be revived. It is rumored that only legendary Pokémon may have such power.</p>

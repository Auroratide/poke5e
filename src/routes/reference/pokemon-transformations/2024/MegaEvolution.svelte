<p>In an effort of simplication, <em>any</em> final stage Pok√©mon can mega-evolve, requiring only one single Mega Evolution stone in the game, "Megalite".</p>
<p>When a pokemon mega-evolves, it breaks the boundaries of evolution by changing form and becoming stronger.</p>
<p>A pokemon may only mega-evolve if it meets all of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is at a final stage of its evolution line.</li>
	<li>It is at least level 10.</li>
	<li>It is holding a Megalite Stone.</li>
	<li>Its trainer possesses a Key Stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a pokemon mega-evolves:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Its AC increases by 2.</li>
	<li>It doubles its ability score modifiers for attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throw rolls, and saving throw DCs.</li>
	<li>Its type <em>may</em> change. Use one of the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mega_Evolution#Pok%C3%A9mon_capable_of_Mega_Evolution" rel="noreferrer">canon transformations</a>, or work with your DM on what makes sense.</li>
	<li>Its physical form changes to something epic!</li>
</ul>
<p>A mega-evolved pokemon reverts back to its original form when any of the conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At the end of combat, if used during combat.</li>
	<li>After 10 minutes, if used outside of combat.</li>
	<li>When the pokemon faints.</li>
	<li>If the trainer loses possession of their Key Stone.</li>
</ul>
